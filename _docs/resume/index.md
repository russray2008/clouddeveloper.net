 * Designed and developed in-house utility using OpenCSV and Apache POI for ingesting 1.2K records, enriching the data, and uploading into the system of record.  This resulted in nearly $50K and over 800 man-hours in savings.   

* Produced easy consumable infromation for development and texting executives using a simple linear regression algorithm and combined with a data visualization tool.  This resulted in a predictive model and early identification of KPIs for the successful launch of the product involving 34 applications across the enterprise.

* Authorized six company videos (tutorials) using in the education of internal users on the usage of electronic signatures and electronic forms.  This required learning and using the Adobe Premier Pro CC tool. The short one-minute videos resulted in the increase demand for component-based services and electronice signatures for contracts.

* Trained five system analysts on eliciting approximnately 1K technical requirements for system development involving Oracle database, microservices architected applications, DataStage ETL, UX, and electronic forms.  Each analyst was taught the use of Visio, block diagramming, target-source data mapping, wireframe prototypeing, and mockups.

* Spun up five distributed Agile teams using Rational Team Concert (RTC), Confluence, team metrics while providing training to 25 team members on estimating development work.  This resulted in all teams fully embracing the Agile methodology and improving their delivery of component software.

* Coached and encouraged project teams on the use/capability of industry tools for tracking 1.2K requirements and approximately 10K test cases in the intial launch for the re-platforming of critical components involving annuities.  This resultsed in the customization of Rational Team Concert and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) for over 100 teams.

* Researched and demonstrated through a proof-of-concept how a separated process could tie into an existing Mule process then captilized on and gain reuse of existing processes with little effort.  This saved approximately a week in development time for the team.

* Designed and audit solution using existing architecture whereby other developers could implement cross cutting across the application for logging and auditing information using special annotations.  This spring-boarded the implementation for an auditiing trail of bank information at the enterprise level.

* Created personas, user scenarios, cross-functional workflows and storyboards using PowerPoint, Visio, and Pencil.  This surfaced a more detailed understanding of the process for requesting reports involving legal entity organization and anti-money laundry operations for the technical team.

* Mentor four development teams in their adoption and omplementation of Agile.  This led to the creation of a separate release plan for each product, creation/loading of features/stories in Rally, and setting up a continuous integration build process using maven, ANT, and Jenkins. 

* **Environment:** Eclipse 4.x, Intellij 2017.3.2, AnyPoint Studio, Maven-3.x, Oracle-11-g, JDK 1.7, Mule-3.6.1, AspectJ, Apache-Commons, Apache-ActiveMQ 5.1.2, Subversion, MS-Visio, SuperPutty, PowerShell, WinSCP, MS-Office, WebLogic-10.3, Windows-7, Redhat Linux 2.6.9, Pencil.
