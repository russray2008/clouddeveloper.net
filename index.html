        <h1>Journey toward Cloud Development using Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h1>
        <p>This is my individual journey as I use several industry tools for publishing a static website hosted on AWS.
          My goal was taking the fastest route (in my eyes) for spinning up a website.  Others may find a faster path.</p>

              <p>I see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> as a wave of the future for small and large businesses moving their operations to a PaaS in their battle for reducing 
                application development cost.  The potential savings is huge as a company only pays for the services an organization uses when compared to the cost
                of maintaining a data center supported 24/7/365.  Moreover, businesses who find an online business model cost prohibited now has another stream of revenue--online shopping through AWS.  
            </p>
            <p> Seeing the potential of this new wave of technology offered through AWS, I have embarked on my jouney of learning what it takes to bring up a site.</p>

            <p>My first step was finding a way to building a website quickly.  I came across a tool call <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It is a quick way
                of using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> for 
                quick site generation.  It also provided me with a means on rebranding the standard theme to my specific needs and wishes. A key factor in my decision 
                was the cost.  These tools were <strong>free</strong>.
